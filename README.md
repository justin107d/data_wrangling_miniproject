# data_wrangling_miniproject

Created to prove programming skills using python 
and applying them to this JSON file.  The goals 
of this project are to:
  
    1)  Find the 10 countries with most projects.
    
    2)  Find the top 10 major project themes (using 
    column 'mjtheme_namecode').
    
    3)  In 2. above you will notice that some entries 
    have only the code and the name is missing. Create 
    a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
